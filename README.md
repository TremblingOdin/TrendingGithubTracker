The project was initialized with bootstrap by `npx create-react-app` in order to save time during the setup, especially when it came to setting up the toolchain. I hope this is acceptable, with the 90 minute time limit I focused more on displaying an understanding of JS, React, and CSS rather than if I knew how to setup the package.JSON, or the toolchain.

As a result of initializing the app this way, it can be run in development mode via `npm start`, and it can be built for production with `yarn build` outputting to the default build folder.
